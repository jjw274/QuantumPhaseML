# QuantumPhaseML
A machine learning framework for classifying ractional quantum Hall phases using TQFT invariants. Features include generating warped lattice geometries, calculating entanglement entropy, Berry curvature, and Chern numbers, and using GNN/CNN models for topological phase classification in torus and cylinder manifolds.
